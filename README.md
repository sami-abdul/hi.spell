# hi.spell

hi.spell is a ridiculously simple and aesthetically elegant/minimal experience reading news on crypto/blockchain.

Simple sentences that could be read while running and said without taking extra breaths. Users activate the news or tips with the "+" symbol but only a few words that condense the overall meaning are revealed at a time.
